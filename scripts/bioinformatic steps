#We now have the file from galaxy, but with the annoying issue that a few sequences returned (<0.1%) were a special combination of junk that actually matched all the parameters on both sides of the reverse complement. So we have occasional duplicate sequencenames, which mothur hates.

#First, make a file of the names of the duplicates
cat Galaxy12Filtersequencesbylengthondata11.fasta | grep '^>' | sort | uniq -d > duplicate_sequencename

#Then use the biopython script to remove these sequences


#Then use the groupfile reducing script to make sure we only have the groups info for sequences which still exist. I did this in an array, splitting the fasta into 500 smaller files, to speed it up


#Then use the fasta_length_filtering script to collapse haplotypes and length filter

#Rename the output files using rename (installed via homebrew)

#Then use the galaxy-R workflow
