This is the R-project for all of the code for a paper using DNA metabarcoding to look at the dietary ecology of Hipposideros cervinus in the rainforests of Sabah. All data will be published with the upcoming paper. Please direct any questions to me at hemprich.bennett@gmail.com

Sadly I changed from using 'data/output_data' to the far superior 'results' for output results partway through, so some may be disorganised
